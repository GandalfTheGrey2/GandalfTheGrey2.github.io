                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    <h4>August 2023-April 2024</h4>
                    I started out going to Calhoun Community College during this year and only took some 
                    foundaitonal courses. 

                    <h4>October 2024-Current</h4>
                    Now, I am enrolled in Western Governors University, studying 
                    for my Bachelors of Science in Information Technology. Web development is apart of the 
                    degree, so I decided why not learn it and make this website at the same time.

            <h3>&#128220 My Certificates:</h3>
                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    <h4>August 2023-November 2023</h4>
                    Through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy.com</a>, I studied Computer Science. 
                    I learned Python, Git, data structures, trees and graphs, algorithms, databases incorporating SQL, 
                    computer architecture, and discrete math. While this isn't on the same level as a computer science degree, this
                    certificate helped me to understand the concepts and use that knowledge within my code.  

                    <h4>December 2023-May 2024</h4>
                    During this time, I studied for and completed the CompTIA A+ and Security+. I utilized 
                    free online course videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@professormesser" target="_blank">Professor Messer</a> 
                    and paid for his course notes and practice exams to prepare for these certificates. I learned hardware, Windows OS, Mac OS,
                    Linux, cloud computing, cybersecurity concepts, incident response, data protection, virtualization, etc.  

                    <h4>June 2024-September 2024</h4>
                    Since I was out for summer, I decided to enroll in <a href="https://tryhackme.com/" target="_blank">TryHackMe.com</a>
                    and learn hands on cybersecurity. I earned the SOC Level 1 and Jr Penetration Tester certificates. Within the SOC Level 1, I
                    learned concepts such as Cyber Defence Frameworks, Cyber Threat Intelligence tools, Network Security 
                    and Traffic Analysis like Snort and Wireshark, Endpoint Security Monitoring like Event Logs, SIEM like Splunk, 
                    Digital Forensics tools like Autopsy. Within the Jr Penetration Tester, I learned concepts such as Web Hacking with Burp Suite, Network Security 
                    like NMAP, Vulnerability Research, Metasploit, and Privilege Escalation techniques. These lists are incomplete. However, this is where I learned I 
                    heavily enjoyed cybersecurity, especially Penetration Testing. I did also attempt the CompTIA Network+ but failed by 20 points, I will be taking
                    that exam again with my degree at WGU. 

                    <h4>October 2024-Current</h4>
                    I just did earn my ITIL v4 Foundations certificate. I utilized the course content that WGU provides as well as Jason Dion's course 
                    and practice exams. I learned the ITIL terminology and IT Service Management. I will be taking the CompTIA Project+, Network+, AWS Cloud
                    Practitioner, and LPI Linux Essentials exams with my degree plan soon.

            <h3>&#128188 My Career Goals:</h3>
                <div class="aboutme-p">
                    I want to hopefully start out as a Systems Administrator or similar role after graduation. After working that for a few years, I want to
                    obtain a Masters Degree in Cybersecurity at WGU. Then, eventually move into some Cybersecurity Analyst or Penetration Tester position. From there, 
                    I am still deciding but I'm grateful I know where I want to be within the coming years.
