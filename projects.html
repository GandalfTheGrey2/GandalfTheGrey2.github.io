                    This is my first Python project. I used a combination of functions and loops to create the
                    tabletop game of battleship.

                    This project focused on using the A-star algorithm to find a route from a specified point A and 
                    point B. The returned array gives you which buildings you start at, which buildings you pass, and your 
                    final destination.

                    This simple project uses the Python Random Module and a simple algorithm to create a string of random

                    This is my first "complex" fake website. It was my first time mixing JavaScript into the HTML and CSS. 
                    I did want to make a backend database for PHP to connect to but decided against it. This website isn't responsive.

                    The website you are currently on is this project. It was made for people to view my information easier. 
                    Except, my link can't be changed unless I pay. However, I don't think this will be an issue to anyone. This website 
                    is my best attempt so far on responsiveness.
